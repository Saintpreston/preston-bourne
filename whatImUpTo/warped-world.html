    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Final Project for my Sophomore year, the prompt is a virtual music video based on any audio at least three minutes long. The project must be done using Unity Game Engine and only limited online FBX imports were allowed. 
        The emphasis is on environmental design, world building and interactivity
    </p>

    <h2>Goal</h2>
  <p>  I usually go for more reserved, industrial designs with tame colors. I decided to break the pattern and create VR psychedilic journey. The song of choice is
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_XZHJrbQ1Q">Rejjie Snow - Acid Trip</a> and the visuals are heavily inspired by
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kQWAqjFJS0">Midnight Gospel</a> a visual series by the world renowned Pendleton Ward, known primarily for Adventure Time.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

    Currently, <ul>
    <li>Implementing the post-processing to sell the pyschedelic feeling.</li>
    <li>Modeling more assets for the scene in Blender</li>
    <li>Building city, valley & underwater landscapes</li>
    <li>Scripting in C# to increase player's interactivity and agency over the world</li>
    <li>Synchronizing the pacing and player interactions with audio</li>
</ul>

<!--<h2>Reflections</h2>-->
<!--<p>As all good User Interfaces should be, this is a work in progress. A breakdown of the typography element was intentionally omitted because going for contemporary aesthetics whilst choosing a serif font can be perceived as contradictory. Monospace fonts feel the most in tune with a futuristic, "techy" design but those can also be jarring and are best suited for desktops and laptops rather than smaller screens. I like the roboto choice because it is a system font which feels in place with the aforementioned "techy" feel however the slab serif roboto may be overused.-->

<!--I'm also considering a darker shade of blue in the background as to further emphasize the neon green, however black and neon green is quite a common combination in digital and tangible product design.-->
<!--The goal should always to be improved yet recognizable however I've gotten feedback that the contrast can be a bit jarring. The logo also closely resembles that of an existing yet non-competing company which is acceptable but never ideal. I'm currently working on the rest of the screens and revising the current style choices. As always, I'm open to informed feedback so if you have any suggestions drop me an email.</p>-->
