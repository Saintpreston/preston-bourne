    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This was a group assignment for my Intro to Design studies class, which focused on how we can design ethically,
        based on social need and accessibility. With the entire group being interested in Tech, we decided to research
        how modern tech shapes the society around us and build a contemporary website based on said research. Whilst 
        browsing, we came across the term <a href="http://www.technocapitalism.com/">Technocapitalism</a>, coined by a
        popular author Luis Suarez-Villa. My role was to co-design in Figma and do all the development. My group
        members took care of research.

        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>  Whilst the information on Prof. Suarez Villa's site was still exceedingly relevant, the design was a bit
            outdated. So we decided to reach out to him and propose a redesign alongside being able to mix our own
            research with his own ideas. With this being for a final project I wanted to take some inspiration from
            the style of PowerPoint/Keynote presentations, hence the bold titles.
            <br>
            I didn't want to completely
            stray from the original page so I decided to keep the black, yellow and white color palette but made it
            occupy more space. The contrast on the original site is a bit jarring, so I kept the theme of strong
            contrast but decided to use the difference in colors more tastefully.
            <br>
            I enjoyed the idea of having an
            index page that appeared to have no information but viewers could explore via the arrows and
            discover. There's an intangible sense of reward that users feel when they hover, see an animation then
            click the arrow to reveal more info. <a href="https://github.com/Saintpreston/TechnoCapRedesign">View Repository</a>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p>A lot of the information covered here is intentionally surface level. We live in an era where so many
            terms are being thrown around and people that aren't overtly asking questions may have a hard time
            understanding said language. Whilst there is a more in depth research paper attached to the project. I
            wanted to keep the wording simple because if for instance you were to go on Google Chrome and search "What
            is a
        BlockChain?" you're often given a definition that leaves you with further questions.</p>

        <h2>Reflections</h2>
        <p>As all good User Interfaces should be, this is a work in progress. I'd like to acknowledge that at the
            time of reading this the site may not yet be responsive. It being in the midst of finals it was
            developed only for Desktop view. However, as I find the time over summer break, I intend to make it
            responsive and potentially even add to the research element because someone looking for more in depth
            analysis may find it a bit sparse.</p>
