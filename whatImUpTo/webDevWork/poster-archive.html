    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
       A peer of mine was given the task to design an archival website. Inspired by the concept of digital museums they decided to use Swiss Posters, However for the posters to be organized and filtered, it would have to live in an API. Since they are only trained in HTML & CSS I was able to do the Javascript and allow users to filter through the posters based on given parameters.

        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>
            Whilst for this project I took a backseat in the design, I did have the input of deciding against vertical scrolling and making the user being to scroll in 2 dimensions for a more immersive experience.  Development wise, you may notice that even though the filters "work" and they do remove the posters that aren't relevant, the ones that are on display remain in their original space. Next steps are making the website reorganize itself based on the filters. The styling of the filter input is also a bit outdated and I'm exploring ways to make this sleeker.<a href="">View Repository</a> </p>

        <h2>Reflections</h2>
        <p>
            Since creating this I was able to get React.js under my belt so I'll likely redo using the frame work and render the content more dynamically.
            <br>
            As all good User Interfaces should be, this is a work in progress. I'd like to acknowledge that at the
            time of reading this the site may not yet be responsive. It being in the midst of finals it was
            developed only for Desktop view. However, as I find the time over summer break, I intend to make it
            responsive and potentially even add to the research element because someone looking for more in depth
            analysis may find it a bit sparse.</p>
