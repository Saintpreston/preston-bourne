    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Final Project for my Core Lab Environments class, Sophomore year, the prompt was to create a virtual space with at least three minutes of
        exploration time.
        The project must be done using the Unity Game Engine and only limited amount of third party assets were
        allowed.
        The emphasis is on environmental design, world building and interactivity.
    </p>

    <h2>Goal</h2>
  <p>  I usually go for more reserved, industrial designs with tame colors. I decided to break the pattern and create
      psychedelic journey with the option to be experienced in VR. So far I've been able to make a build compatible
      with the QUEST 2.
      The visuals are heavily
      inspired by
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kQWAqjFJS0">Midnight Gospel</a> a visual series by the renowned Pendleton Ward, known primarily for Adventure Time.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

    Currently, <ul>
    <li>Constructing better hard surface models for the house in the first scene and the UFO interior.</li>
    <li>Tweaking UVs</li>
    <li>Reimagining the Grey-boxing for a less linear walk-through.</li>
    <li>Adding more complex C# to increase player's interactivity and agency over the world</li>
</ul>

<p>A trained eye may notice a few structural problems with the first house, the interior of the ufo, and clouds not being seamless in the final scene.

    This is still in the draft stage so trust that a lot of the architecture is a placeholder and will be replaced for the final working demo.
    Currently working on my C# scripts to increase user agency/interactivity & taking a course in hard surface modeling.
    
    With finals being over and having more free time, I may even "remix" the project in Unreal Engine as an excuse to practice C++.</p>

<!--<h2>Reflections</h2>-->
<!--<p>As all good User Interfaces should be, this is a work in progress. A breakdown of the typography element was intentionally omitted because going for contemporary aesthetics whilst choosing a serif font can be perceived as contradictory. Monospace fonts feel the most in tune with a futuristic, "techy" design but those can also be jarring and are best suited for desktops and laptops rather than smaller screens. I like the roboto choice because it is a system font which feels in place with the aforementioned "techy" feel however the slab serif roboto may be overused.-->

<!--I'm also considering a darker shade of blue in the background as to further emphasize the neon green, however black and neon green is quite a common combination in digital and tangible product design.-->
<!--The goal should always to be improved yet recognizable however I've gotten feedback that the contrast can be a bit jarring. The logo also closely resembles that of an existing yet non-competing company which is acceptable but never ideal. I'm currently working on the rest of the screens and revising the current style choices. As always, I'm open to informed feedback so if you have any suggestions drop me an email.</p>-->
